 * not understand

 *
 * From the dpdp solution, we can observe that for kk consecutive elements sastisfying the common
 * difference criteria, we update the sumsum for each such element by 1, 2, 3, ..., k1,2,3,...,k
 * counts in that order. Thus, instead of updating the sumsum at the same time, we can just keep a
 * track of the number of consecutive elements satisfying the common differnce criteria in a countcount
 * variable and just update the sumsum directly as count*(count+1)/2countâˆ—(count+1)/2 whenver an element
 * not satisfying this criteria is found. At the same time, we also need to reset the countcount value.
