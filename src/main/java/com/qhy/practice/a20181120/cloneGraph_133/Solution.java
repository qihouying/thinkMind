 *  Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors .
 OJ's undirected graph serialization: Nodes are labeled uniquely.
 We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
 As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.
 The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated
 by #.
     1. First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
     2. Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
     3. Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-
     cycle.
 Visually, the graph looks like the following:
     1 /\ /\ 0 --- 2
     /\ \_/
