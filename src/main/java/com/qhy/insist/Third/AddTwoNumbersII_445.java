 * @Description [Medium]
 *
 * You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first
 * and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
 *
 * You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
 *
 * Follow up:
 * What if you cannot modify the input lists? In other words, reversing the lists is not allowed.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: (7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
 * Output: 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 7
